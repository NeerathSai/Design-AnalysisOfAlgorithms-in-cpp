Write an algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers 
using Euclid’s algorithm. Determine the time and space complexity of the algorithm. Write a 
program to implement the Euclid’s algorithm. Plot the order of growth graph for the number of 
times the basic operation of this algorithm will be executed for different input sizes.
